    "\n",
    "**Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.**\n",
    "\n",
    "IE It's better to have many small interfaces than a few large ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What does this mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a class should not be required to implement methods it doesn't need. Instead of having a large, monolithic interface, it's better to have smaller, specific interfaces tailored to the needs of individual classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a violation of this principle each time you have to override a method and provide an empty implementation or raise an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are developing a system for managing different types of documents: Text documents and PDF documents. We create an interface called Document to represent a generic document and define methods like open(), save(), and print().\n",
    "\n",
    "``` java \n",
    "public interface Document {\n",
    "    void open();\n",
    "    void save();\n",
    "    void print();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Next, we implement classes for each document type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class TextDocument implements Document {\n",
    "    // Implementation for Text document\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class PDFDocument implements Document {\n",
    "    // Implementation for PDF document\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, this design may seem reasonable. However, the problem arises when we realize that not all document types support all the operations defined in the Document interface. For example, the PDFDocument class might support all the methods, but the TextDocument class may not support the print() method since it doesn't make sense for a plain text document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Interface Segregation Principle comes into play here. Instead of having a single monolithic interface, we should split it into smaller, more focused interfaces. For this example, we can create two interfaces, one for basic document operations and another for printing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "interface BasicDocument {\n",
    "    void open();\n",
    "    void save();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "interface PrintableDocument {\n",
    "    void print();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can have each document type implement only the relevant interfaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` java\n",
    "class TextDocument implements BasicDocument {\n",
    "    // Implementation for Text document\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class PDFDocument implements BasicDocument, PrintableDocument {\n",
    "    // Implementation for PDF document\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the Interface Segregation Principle, we avoid forcing classes to implement unnecessary methods, which makes the code cleaner, easier to understand, and reduces potential mistakes. If we hadn't applied ISP, the TextDocument class would have had to provide an empty implementation or raise an exception for the print() method, even though it didn't need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use the Interface Segregation Principle:\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing interfaces for classes: Before creating a large interface, consider whether all the methods are relevant for every class that will implement it. If not, break it down into smaller, more specific interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "When refactoring existing code: If you find that a class implements methods that are not used or not applicable to its functionality, consider refactoring the code and segregating the interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "When collaborating with a team: ISP helps in making the codebase more modular and easier for different team members to work on separate parts without overlapping responsibilities. It encourages a clear separation of concerns."
